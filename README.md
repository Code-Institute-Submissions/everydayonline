# everydayonline

everydayonline is a e-commerce store built using Pythons Django framework, and hosted using Heroku.
The main function of the app is to allow users to browse the range of products and buy which they 
see fit. Users can also add, edit and delete their own products but wont be-able to affect products
posted by other users.

- ### Design
    - #### Bootstrap 4
        - Bootstrap is a CSS framework that was used to build this app. 

    - #### Layout
        - The everydayonline app uses the Bootstrap 4 framework which I used throughout the site to keep the
        design / layour the same by utilising Bootstraps built-in classes. By using the row and column classes,
        I was easily able to quickly put together a simplistic yet professional looking layout without having 
        too add much(if any) custom CSS.

    - #### Icon Set
        - Font Awesome has been used throughout the project, across all sections, ranging from icons in the 
        nav bar through to the checkout page and everything in between. These icons are built into the Bootstrap
        framework and really help illustrate the page.

    - #### Database
        - Django uses SQL databases. During development, the Django default sqlite3 database was used. When deployed 
        to Heroku, a PostgreSQL database was used.
